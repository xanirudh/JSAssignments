Day 2 Question 2 
Explain with examples the remaining methods of String and Array.
======================================================================

1. substring
   The substring() method extracts the characters from a string, between two specified indices, and returns the new sub string.

   Example:
   let str = "Hello world!";
   let res = str.substring(2);

2. slice
   The slice() method extracts parts of a string and returns the extracted parts in a new string.

   Example:
   let str = "Hello world!";
   let res = str.slice(0);

3. replaceAll
   The replaceAll() method returns a new string with all matches of a pattern replaced by a replacement.

   Example:
   const p = 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. If the dog reacted, was it really lazy?';
   console.log(p.replaceAll(regex, 'ferret'));
   // expected output: "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy ferret. If the ferret reacted, was it really lazy?"

4. replace
   The replace() method searches a string for a specified value, or a regular expression, and returns a new string where the specified values are replaced.

   Example:
   let str = "Mr Blue has a blue house and a blue car";
   let res = str.replace(/blue/g, "red");
